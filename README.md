# Splat World
Charles Begle, David Ciprano, Moss Limpert, Rose Rushton, and Zimu Wu's IGME 320 project, Splat World. 

Claim school turf by leaving your tag, the more turf you cover, the stronger you become, and the more levels you gain. Work with your friends to create giant, complex murals, and form crews so you can all expand your turf together! Fight against rival crews and friends by taking over their turf, notifying them that they have to get back out there and create more art! Post short blurbs accompanying your tags, explaining your piece, or posting about your history with the location you tagged.

Our project uses Unity and Lightship VPS by Niantic.
